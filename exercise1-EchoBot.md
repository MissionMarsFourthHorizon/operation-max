# Exercise 1: Creating Your First "Echo" Bot with the Bot Builder SDK

The goal of the first exercise is to create your first bot using [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com).

## Exercise Goals

To successfully complete this exercise, you must complete the following tasks:

* Configure your development environment
* Create a bot that accepts input from a user, "echoes" or sends the same text back to the user

## C#

### Prerequisites

[Visual Studio 2017 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) or higher is required to create bots. [Bot Framework Emulator](https://emulator.botframework.com/), which is the client you will use for testing your bot, is also required.

## Node.js

### Prerequisites

You will need both a code editor installed, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), and the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime. [Bot Framework Emulator](https://emulator.botframework.com/), which is the client you will use for testing your bot, is also required.

## Resources

* You may find helpful resources in the [Bot Framework documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/).

* For Node.js, you may also want to use an additional package for managing environmental variables, such as [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).
