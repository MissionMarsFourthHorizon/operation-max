  "text": "Use your voice to do many of the same things you do with gestures on HoloLens—even take a quick photo or open an app. And when you're using the holographic keyboard, try dictation mode for an easy way to type.\n\nGet around HoloLens faster with these basic commands. To see more commands, check out  [Cortana on HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12630), or just say &quot;Hey Cortana, what can I say?&quot;\n\n**Select**. Use this instead of air tap. Gaze at a hologram, then say &quot;Select.&quot;\n\n**Place**. Instead of air tapping to place a hologram, say &quot;Place.&quot;\n\n**Face me**. Gaze at a hologram, then say &quot;Face me&quot; to turn it your way.\n\n**Bigger/Smaller**. Gaze at a hologram, then say &quot;Bigger&quot; or &quot;Smaller&quot; to resize it.\n\n**Hey Cortana, go to Start**. Use this instead of  [bloom](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12644) to get to Start.\n\n**Hey Cortana, shut down**. Turn off your HoloLens.\n\n**Hey Cortana, move &lt;app name> here**. Gaze at the spot you want the app to move to.\n\n**Hey Cortana, take a picture**. Snap a quick photo.\n\nMany buttons and other elements on HoloLens also respond to your voice—for example,  **Adjust**  and  **Remove**  on the app bar. To find out if a button is voice enabled, rest your gaze on it for a moment. If it is, you'll see a voice tip."
